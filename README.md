```
from drf_haystack.serializers import HaystackSerializer
from drf_haystack.viewsets import HaystackViewSet

from myapp.search_indexes import PersonIndex  # BYOIâ„¢ (Bring Your Own Index)

# Serializer
class PersonSerializer(HaystackSerializer):
    class Meta:
        index_classes = [PersonIndex]
        fields = ["firstname", "lastname", "full_name"]

# ViewSet
class PersonSearchViewSet(HaystackViewSet):
    index_models = [Person]
    serializer_class = PersonSerializer
```

That's it, you're good to go. Hook it up to a DRF router and happy searching!
